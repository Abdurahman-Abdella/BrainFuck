A small Brainfuck interpreter written from scratch in Python.

Built as a personal challenge to understand how an extremely minimal programming language can be executed by an interpreter. Brainfuck has only eight commands:

```text
> < + - . , [ ]
```

Despite its simplicity, writing and debugging Brainfuck programs can be surprisingly difficult.

One of the first successful tests was the classic Hello World program:

```brainfuck
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]
>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.
>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```

which produces:

```text
Hello World!
```

Usage:

```bash
python brainfuck.py yourcode.bf
```

The interpreter can also be used as a Python module:

```python
import brainfuck

brainfuck.evaluate(sourcecode)
```

Built with Python as a hands-on exercise in interpreters, memory, pointers, loops, and program execution.
